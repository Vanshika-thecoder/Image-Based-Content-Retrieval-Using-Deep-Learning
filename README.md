Image-Based Content Retrieval Using Deep Learning

Overview

This project implements a **Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR)** system using deep learning–based feature extraction and vector similarity search. The goal is to retrieve visually similar images from a database by leveraging pretrained CNN models and scalable vector databases.

This repository contains the **project report (PDF)** along with supporting notebooks/code used in the research.


Project Objectives

* Develop an end-to-end **image retrieval system** capable of matching and ranking similar images.
* Use **deep learning feature extraction** with pretrained CNN architectures.
* Improve performance and reduce dimensionality using **PCA**.
* Enable high-speed similarity search using the **Milvus vector database**.

Key Features

* Multiple CNN models used for feature extraction:

  * **VGG16**
  * **ResNet50**
  * **InceptionV3**

* **Feature vector optimization** using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

* **Scalable similarity search** using:

  * Milvus Vector Database
  * L2 / Cosine similarity metrics

* Comprehensive evaluation of feature quality and retrieval accuracy.


Tech Stack
